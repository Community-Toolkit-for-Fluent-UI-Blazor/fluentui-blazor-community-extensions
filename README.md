# FluentUI Blazor Community Extensions
This package is for use in .NET 9 Blazor projects.

## Introduction

The `FluentUI.Blazor.Community.Components` package provides a collection of open-source Razor components that extend the official [Microsoft FluentUI Blazor Library](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-blazor).

### Component Overview

The components are organized into two main categories:

#### 1. Custom Components
These components are specifically designed to seamlessly follow the **FluentUI design principles**, offering additional functionality and consistent styling beyond what the official library provides.

#### 2. Composite Components
These components are created by **combining multiple official FluentUI components**. They deliver higher-level building blocks that represent common UI patterns out of the box.

### Getting Started

To using this library, you first need to install the package via NuGet. You can use the NuGet package manager in your IDE or use the following command when using a CLI:

```
dotnet add package FluentUI.Blazor.Community.Components
```

#### Add Imports
After the package is added, you need to add the following in your `_Imports.razor`

```razor
@using FluentUI.Blazor.Community.Components
```

### Support

The FluentUI Blazor Community Extensions is an open source project. It is built and maintained by community members and offers support, like most other open source projects, on a best effort base through the GitHub repository **only**.
