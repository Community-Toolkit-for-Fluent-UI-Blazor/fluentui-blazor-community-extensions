    <Description>
        The <code>FluentCxSleekDial</code> has the capability to be hidden. This sample shows how to do that.
        In this sample, four dials are shown with different visibility modes.
        One dial is always visible (the bottom left), the second one is hidden when it has no visible items,
        the third one is hidden when all its items are invisible and the last one is hidden when it has no visible items or all its items are invisible.
